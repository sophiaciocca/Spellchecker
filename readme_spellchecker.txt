/**********************************************************************
 *  What is the point of the interface List?  What does it mean for
 *  a Java class (e.g., LinkedList) to implement an interface?
 **********************************************************************/

    An interface defines a contract which an implementing class must adhere to.
    The interface List defines a set of operations that must be supported by
    LinkedList. So, a class that actually implements the interfact should 
    implement all the methods declared in the interface. 
    
    Interfaces act as APIs; they declare the methods and make the classes
    implement them. So if you deliver the software package to 
    a client, the client can invoke the methods by looking at the method
    signatures declared inside the interfaces, but won't see the actual
    implementation of the methods. 



/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) that you received
 **********************************************************************/

 LOTS of TAs. Alex, VanJessica, Hamza, Jack, and others. This was
    an office-hours-heavy assignment for me.


/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/

No serious problems except serious time-consuming-ness and a 
    lack of understanding on how to really debug efficiently.


/**********************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback   
 *  on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether    
 *  you enjoyed doing it.

    I definitely feel like I understand LinkedLists a little bit better.
    And I really enjoyed doing the SpellChecker class (the fourth part)!
